# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A predictive algorithm that uses historical data for predicting the incoming demand for groceries in the coming week. This way grocery stores can optimize their supply of different products according to the expexted demand and thus reduce unnecessary waste and increase the profitability of the store.


## Background

This would solve the enormous problem of groceries with short shelf lives going to waste.

## How is it used?

The process starts with recording the demand for products to see how the seasonal demand for groceries varies during the year. The algorithm would suggest the amount of diferent products that should be supplied during the year based on the history and adjust according to the precision of the predicted demand.


## Challenges

The problem with the identification of variables that predict the demand of groceries is the complexity of human behavior. Furthermore, variables affecting the demand for product can be external and hard to identify. For example, a grocery store could experience a sudden decline in demand due to an entry of a competitor and not being able to gather data on the demand in the competitors store could be a problem.
